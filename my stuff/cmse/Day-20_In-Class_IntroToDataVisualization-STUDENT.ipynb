We run into trouble when we try to add too much description, and we end up taking up a lot of space, potentially in attempting to be a little too on the nose with the story of our plot. \n",

Also, **we could probably make some improvements to how we've formatted the axis labels for the x-axis**, right now it's pretty hard to read those. **How might we improve the readability while also perhaps using the space more effectively?**\n",
