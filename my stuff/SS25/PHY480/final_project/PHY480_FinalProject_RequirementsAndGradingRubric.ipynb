    "# PHY 480 Final Project\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Overall requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For your semester project, **you'll be expected to turn a Jupyter notebook that contains the following**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All of the code used to complete your project. The code should be documented so that the instructor can understand what you did and why you did it. This means including meaningful comments in the code itself! You should also use logical variable names to ease the reading of the code.\n",
    "* Narrative text (using Markdown cells) that explains what you did, why you did it, and how you went about it. You should break the notebook up into the following meaningful sections so that the instructor can follow the logical flow of your work:\n",
    "\t- **Background and Motivation** (Provide some context for the problem and what question(s) you set out to answer.)\n",
    "\t- **Methodology** (How did you go about answering your question(s)? Most of your code will be\n",
    "contained in this section.)\n",
    "\t- **Results** (What did you find when you carried out your methods? Some of your code related to\n",
    "presenting results/figures/data may be replicated from the methodology section or may only be present in\n",
    "this section.)\n",
    "\t- **Discussion and Conclusion** (What did you learn from your results? What obstacles did you run into? What would you do differently next time? Clearly provide quantitative answers to your question(s).)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The code, text, and visuals should be threaded together as coherent report of your work!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the notebook, you will be giving a **7 minute** presentation using a short set of slides to share the results of your project with your fellow classmates and your instructors. Your presentation should include appropriate **visual aids**. Your presentation should address:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **question(s)** you set out to answer.\n",
    "* The **computational techniques** that you used to address the questions.\n",
    "* The **answer(s)** you arrived at.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation slides\n",
    "\n",
    "The slides may be produced with any software that allows for exporting to pdf format. You will turn in a PDF of your slides along with your Jupyter notebook to D2L. You should aim for having a reasonable number of slides -- a good rule of thumb is ~1 min of time per slide. For a presentation of this length, you probably wouldn't want to have more than 7-8 slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The slides should**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Address the above points in a logical order.\n",
    "* Include a title slide with your project title, name, and course number.\n",
    "* Effectively communicate information through a combination of text and figures. Text and figures should be legible.\n",
    "* Only include text and figures that support the presentation (avoid including content \"just because\").\n",
    "* Avoid large paragraphs of text, use bullet points instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation/project will be graded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One quarter of the grade (**25 points**) comes from the oral presentation. Is it clear and well-structured? Does the student effectively communicate the key ideas about their results?\n",
    "\t* *Excellent presentation*: student speaks clearly and in a logical manner, and makes all the key points clear.  (**25 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Good presentation*: student speaks clearly and logically and conveys key points, but presentation is somewhat lacking. (**19 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Fair presentation*: student's oral presentation is substantially lacking, clarity/logical flow in speaking is sub-par, etc. (**13 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Poor presentation*: student's oral presentation is completely lacking, cannot be heard, there is no logical progression to the presentation. (**7 points**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One quarter of the grade (**25 points**) comes from the student's slides. Do the slides complement their oral presentation, and conform to the guidelines?\n",
    "\t* *Excellent slides*: Slides conform to specifications in final presentation document, including number of slides, adequately addressing all points, legibility. Slides complement oral presentation. (**25 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Good slides*: Slides deviate from specifications in some minor way: too many or too few slides, not all points addressed, some slides hard to understand (poor graphics, too much or too little text, etc.) (**19 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Fair slides*: Slides deviate from specifications in some substantial way: too many or too few slides, half or fewer of points addressed, most slides hard to understand (poor graphics, too much or too little text, etc.) (**13 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Poor slides*: Slides do not conform to specifications in any meaningful way. (**7 points**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One half of the grade (**50 points**) comes from the combination of the content in the student's presentation and in their Jupyter notebook. Does the student clearly and concisely address all of the points listed in the final project guidelines?\n",
    "\t* *Excellent content*: All points clearly and concisely addressed. (**50 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Good content*: Most of the points clearly and concisely addressed, or all points nominally addressed but some are unclear. (**38 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Fair content*: Roughly half of the points clearly and concisely addressed, or all points nominally addressed but half are unclear.(**26 points**)\n",
    "\t* *Poor content*: Few of the points clearly and concisely addressed, or most/all points nominally answered but most are unclear. (**14 points**)\n",
