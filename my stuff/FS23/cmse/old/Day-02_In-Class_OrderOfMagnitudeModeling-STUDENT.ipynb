    "4. If all of the toilet paper used per week in the United States were rolled out across the surface of Michigan could you cover the entire state? If so, could you cover it more than once?\n",
    "5. Which has more mass, the air in this classroom or the brains in this classroom?  \n",
    "6. On average, how many people are airborne in the world at a given moment?  \n",
    "7. How many total miles do all Americans drive in their cars in one year, and how does this compare to the circumference of the Earth ($2.5 \\times 10^4$ miles), the distance from the Earth to the Sun ($9 \\times 10^7$ miles), and size of the Solar System ($10^9$ miles)?\n",

    "3. The reasonable values that would go into the equation(s).\n",
